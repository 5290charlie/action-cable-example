## Chatty: The Rails 5 + Action Cable Example App

This is a really simple chatting app to demonstrate one implementation of Action Cable in a Rails 5 app. Users can sign up/log in with a username and create a chatroom or choose from an existing one to start real-time messaging.

For a walk-through of this application, and to learn more about Action Cable (it's awesome, btw), you can check out [my article on the Heroku blog](coming soon!). 

This app require Ruby 2.3.0 to run.
